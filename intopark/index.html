					<h3>What is IntoPark?</h3>
				</div>
				<div class="panel-body" style="font-size:18">
					IntoPark is free open-source Java game made with <a href="http://jmonkeyengine.org/">jMonkeyEngine 3</a>. 
					IntoPark is a single player 3D strategy game where you are given the rights to build your very own theme park! The catch is to play through 
					unique scenarios and complete a primary "goal" or express your creativity by building cool looking parks. 
					Sounds easy right, but its not. You have to choose between building new buildings and rides, hiring staff, 
					upgrading your old buildings or planting decorations throughout your park.I try to make everything in the park customizable 
					fun, but there is only one me!<br><br>
					
					This game is heavily inspired by RollerCoaster Tycoon 1 & 2. I started making this game in late summer 2013 and I've been 
					developing it as a hobby on and off ever since. Unfortunately I'm not very good with art so UI and 3D models might be a little out of place (Help greatly appreciated).
					This is actually my first public game and I have never worked with anything related to 3D so it is taking me longer time to make this than i thought originally.
